# Water Smart Golf

## Our Project

- ⁠Research & Inspiration: Our journey started with an in-depth analysis of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and a focused study on water management challenges and opportunities in Portugal. We conducted expert interviews and explored global case studies to inform our approach.
- ⁠Implementation: We successfully organized an international webinar, featuring key industry stakeholders from GEO, Costa Navarino, and CNIG, to discuss and promote sustainable practices.
- Impact: With over 70 webinar registrants from 40 different organizations, we engaged and involved more than 100 people and stakeholders in this initiative, receiving positive feedback and fostering valuable discussions on sustainability.
